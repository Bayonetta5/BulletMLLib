# BulletMLLib - Unity version

This is a fork of the [dmanning23's BulletMLLib](https://github.com/dmanning23/BulletMLLib).

We made several modification to make it compatible with Unity 4.3+. It is not up to date as the current version is using `async` and some .NET features that are still not available in Unity (.NET 3.5)  .

Remember this is NOT a Unity plugin. Just a BulletML engine you need to integrate.
 
But we also provide a simple and powerful plugin to integrate simply BulletML that you may check: **[BulletML for Unity](http://pixelnest.io/work/bulletml-for-unity/)**.
